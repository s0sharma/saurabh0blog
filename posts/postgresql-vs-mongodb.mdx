# PostgreSQL vs MongoDB: Choosing the Right Database

Choosing the right database is one of the most critical architectural decisions you'll make for your application. This comprehensive guide compares PostgreSQL and MongoDB across various dimensions to help you make an informed decision.

## Overview

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It's been in active development for over 30 years.

**MongoDB** is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's designed for ease of development and scaling.

## Data Model Comparison

### PostgreSQL: Structured Relational Data

PostgreSQL uses a traditional relational model with tables, rows, and columns:

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Posts table with foreign key relationship
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    author_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    published_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
