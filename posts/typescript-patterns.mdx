# Advanced TypeScript Patterns for Better Code Quality

TypeScript has evolved significantly over the years, introducing powerful type system features that enable developers to write more robust and maintainable code. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore advanced TypeScript patterns that can elevate your code quality and developer experience.

## Conditional Types

Conditional types allow you to create types that depend on a condition, much like ternary operators in JavaScript but at the type level.

```typescript
// Basic conditional type
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;

type Test1 = IsString<string>; // true
type Test2 = IsString<number>; // false

// More practical example: extracting return type
type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;

function getUserData(): { id: number; name: string } {
  return { id: 1, name: "John" };
}

type UserData = ReturnType<typeof getUserData>; // { id: number; name: string }
